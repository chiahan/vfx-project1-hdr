This folder is to conform to the submission requirement of the assignment. The document is just the pre-print or snapshot of the whole project's root. That is, it is the generated result by *README.md*. That's really a great way to prepare your homework report cause, obviously, 

1. we don't need fabulous report but the detailed, scientific, and engineering step-by-step report, github's adoption of markdown is good enough for that;
2. it's good to just write once and use it more than once, the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) policy applies well here;

The final document should be online in this project's root page.
